CONVTEXT='''Hello :)
This is Ternary Demo Arch Mark 1.
This is a nice intro. c:

This VM is a Balanced ternary
computer.

What you see here is actual machine
code autoconverted by the DEV tool:
DEVmakettext.py :)

This is running in the VM in
real-time. Each character takes 1
CPU instruction. thats why these
characters are being displayed like
this. :)

You can see to your right, various
real-time status displays. :)

press escape to stop the VM.

do see the config file.
(BOOTUP.CFG)

you will find help in the DOCS
directory.

this is a TROM.
TROMs are the programs for TDA MK1.

now this is not a supercomputer,
but do have fun :)'''

CONVTEXT='''HI ^-^
Here we have
a raster demo!
info:
the top raster is 27x27
6-trit RGB color (thats 729 colors!)
needs 2 CPU instructions per pixel.
(at most 1458 instructions per full
27x27 image)
try to draw all pixels of 1 color
before changing colors to save
ROM space!


the bottom raster is 9x9
2-trit greyscale. (9 shades)
not a lot of colors on that one.
but it only needs 1 CPU
instruction per pixel! 
(27 instructions needed to draw
full 9x9 image)

both rasters have fill instructions.
try filling with the most common
color to save space!'''

codeBat=""
#just open the output file in your code editor of choice, and copy it 
#into your TROM
#this is how the intros were made :)
outn = open('./DEVmakettext-output.txt', 'w')

for f in CONVTEXT:
	outn.write("+++0" + (libttext.charlook(f)) + "\n")
